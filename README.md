# Pixhawk-Simulink-Instruments
Pixhawk (Ardupilot or PX4) Commuincation with Simulink in real time using Mavlink and displaying the results in graphical standard instrumentats


This project is using Simulink-MAVLink v2.0 by aditya00j to connect to a pixhawk board (PX4 or Ardupilot) and get mavlink data from eighter a UDP,TCP/IP/Serial USB Cable or even telemtery recevier.
After receiveing data you can use data to create your own real time monitoring software based on Simulink or Matlab. 
I used Simulink Flying istruments from Aerospace Blockset for visualization.
